Why are all results in 5.3 Even? They all have either 0 or 2 internal nodes, and thus have kekule port assignments of even length ex. {0,ab,cd,abcd}.
You show an odd Kekule cell earlier in the paper (4.3) with 4 ports. Does this mean that it can be translated/renamed/contracted/fused to obtain 
one of the 7 classes of order 4? Can all odd Kekule cells with port number < 6 be altered to exactly match one of the clasifications?
