Directions: 

Possibly make java version of Hesselink's software

Either way, provide nice GUI Interface
Possible to use Jmol to display things....

In our graph theoretical abstraction, we neglect
all hydrogen atoms.

In our application to graph theory, numerical invariants and the symmetry of the graphs play no roles yet.

In view of
the application to conjugation in carbon chemistry, we could restrict attention
to graphs where all nodes have degrees <= 4. Since we have no use for this
restriction, we do this only in some examples.

We do not know whether the class KC of the Kekulé cells is decidable [4] and [8], 
i.e., whether one can make a computer program that reads (an encoding of) a cell K from its 
input and then computes whether or not K is a Kekulé cell. It is easy to make a computer program 
that enumerates all graphs, and verifies for each of them whether it has K as its Kekulé cell.
This program, however, would not terminate if K is not a Kekulé cell. 
The program therefore only shows that the class KC is semi-decidable.

In order 6, we found 214 classes of linkable cells. Of these, 210 are Kekulé cells while for 4 
of the classes this is presently unknown.

In each case, the graph presented is the first one found by our computer program. We made no effort to 
find graphs that fit the requirements of carbon chemistry. Recall from [7] and [12] that there are rather 
far-reaching methods to transform a graph without changing the Kekulé cell. It is beyond the scope of this 
paper to search for graphs that correspond to stable molecules of alternating hydrocarbons.

For application to carbon chemistry, it would be interesting to see whether all Kekulé cells of Section 5.3 
can be realized in stable molecules.
