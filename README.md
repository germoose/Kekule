A Port is a node with precisely one edge to the remainder of the graph. ie. degree of 1.

A Port Assignment is the set of ports which have a double bond.

A Kekule State is a configuration of bonds, such that every internal node has precisely one double bond.

A Kekule Cell is a set of port assignments which have a corresponding Kekule State. In other words, it is a set
of exterior nodes that have double bonds, but still allow all interior nodes to have a double bond.
